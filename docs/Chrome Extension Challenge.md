# TechX: Chrome Extension Challenge

## Description:

TechX: Chrome Extension Challenge is a competition organized by GDSC BPDC, Dubai, that aims to foster innovation and creativity among college students. The competition welcomes participants from all backgrounds, including *non-coders*, while offering exciting challenges for coders to showcase their skills. 

## Format:

1. **Problem Statement:** Participants are presented with a set of real-world problems or challenges related to various industries or domains. (*similar to GDSC Solution Challenge but this time we will limit the problem*) Say, we can limit the problem statement to environmental sustainability. 

2. **Theorizing an idea:** The concept is to use Google BARD instead of chatgpt or explore Chrome extensions, or something else all together, to enhance their solutions.

3. **Solution Development:** Participants develop their solutions, keeping in mind the target audience, user experience, and impact. *Non-coders can focus on designing prototypes, while coders can implement functional prototypes*.
   
## Example Solution:

A problem could be how to *ensure child safety when browsing the net*.

A possible solution could be: A chrome extension which has the following features -

1. **Content Filtering and Parental Controls**: through blacklist/whitelist or web scraping

2. **Real-time Monitoring and Alerts**: using Google Safe Browsing API for alerts

3. **Social Media Safety**: could prompt feed settings

4. **Screen Time**: Similar to parental controls, possible use of push notification services, such as Firebase Cloud Messaging
